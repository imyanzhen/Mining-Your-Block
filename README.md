# Mining-Your-Block
Complete a python script for block mining. I have provided you a quick recipe, you may want to fill the currently commented out lines. Or code it in your own way! 

In this assignment, please complete the python script so that:
(1) Make sure that your transaction record has your name. You can also put down any messages that you would like to tell me :)
(2) Please change the difficulty to be three leading zeros.
(3) Make sure that the script finds the first nonce and stops wasting energy after that.

Deliverables: Your completed python script uploaded to canvas before Feb-20 23:59 pm. 
Have fun coding!
