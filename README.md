# Mining-Your-Block
A python script for block mining.

In this assignment, please complete the python script so that:
(1) Make sure that your transaction record has your name. You can also put down any messages that you would like to tell me :)
(2) Please change the difficulty to be three leading zeros.
(3) Make sure that the script finds the first nonce and stops wasting enegy after that.

Deliverables: Your completed python script uploaded to canvas before Feb-20 23:59 pm. 
Have fun coding!
